    <!--Quotation-->
    <p>
        <blockquote>
            Being queer means leading a different sort of life. It&rsquo;s not about the mainstream, profit-margins, patriotism, patriarchy or being assimilated. It&rsquo;s not about executive directors, privilege and elitism. It&rsquo;s about being on the margins, defining ourselves; it's about gender-f--- and secrets, what's beneath the belt and deep inside the heart; it&rsquo;s about the night. Being queer is &lsquo;grass roots&rsquo; because we know that everyone of us, every body, every c---, every heart and a-- and d--- is a world of pleasure waiting to be explored. Everyone of us is a world of infinite possibility.
        </blockquote>

    <!--Section One: The Historical Imbalance-->
    <h2>THE HISTORICAL IMBALANCE&mdash;</h2>
    <p>
        The current state of history is in utter imbalance, and it destroys the sacred purpose of history. The imbalance has occurred primarily because principles and theories of writing history in the West have formed to account for the development of society. Annales, Marxist, political, intellectual, economic, cultural, anthropological, and military histories take top-level views of the past. They elide over the individual experiences and particularities to construct an objective account of how events likely happened from a &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; spectator&rsquo;s standpoint. Unconcerned with how particular individuals experienced events and how they made sense of them retrospectively, society-level histories flatten humans into institutions. A person of a particular name, born to a specific family, belonging to a unique location, and occupying a certain mentality becomes figured into broad patterns of behavior, stomped into an occupation, clumped into non-descript social stratifications, and dehumanized into the simplest facts. In other words, society-level histories sand particularities into hegemonic universals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Individual-level histories exist in the Western tradition. They often take the form of biography and narrate the lives of the worthies. These biographies are, in fact, societal histories though. They tell the stories of individuals who transformed society around them. These individuals are typically world leaders, politicians, generals, inventors, artists, and the like. Unlike society-level histories, individual-level histories do pay close attention to particulars but only in service of constructing universal metanarratives. The remnants of individual-level histories, which bear little significance to societal development, are typically found in folktales and religious myths. These histories present their narratives with little historical documentation, however. With little historical documentation and often with moral undertones, these folktales and religious myths serve to extract archetypal characters out of a given society. These archetypes, like Adam and Eve or Robinhood, are effectively dilutions of society into individuals. They are reverse biographies. So, while there are individual-level histories, they virtually always serve to represent the history of society.
    </p>
    <p>
	    The imbalance of Western history is the lack of individual-level history for the sake of aesthetic reflections. History&rsquo;s purpose, as it is today, is to articulate the progression of society through the transformation of recovered subjective details into objective facts. There is nothing inherently wrong with this objective. An account of humanity grants us our inheritance and explains why the world exists as it does. The problem is that history for the sole goal of documenting societal transformation blocks the sacred yet everyday quality of history as <em>art.</em> That is, history ought to connect those of us in the present with those who are in the past for the purpose of developing a sense of being and belonging in the world, resonating utopian futures and hopeful dreams, uncovering new modes of experiencing, and actualizing the sensuous capacities of desiring bodies. This aesthetic style of history is <em>queerstory.</em> Its objective counterpart is <em>hegistory.</em>
    </p>

    <!--Section Two: The Ontological Mistake-->
    <h2>THE ONTOLOGICAL MISTAKE&mdash;</h2>
    <p>
        The rebalancing of history cannot occur with the same basic mechanics of hegistory organizing queerstory. Hegistory&rsquo;s leveling effect&mdash;its integration of particulars into universals, its extraction of particulars for metanarratives, or its dilution of universals into archetypes&mdash;prevents the critical formation of intersubjective space necessary for queerstory. This occurs because hegistory operates by understanding historical subjects as objects for the formation of historical account. Put another way, hegistory makes universals, metanarratives, and archetypes by transforming historical subjects into controllable and predictable historical objects. Hegistory&rsquo;s molding of the <q>unprocessed historical record</q><a href="#hayden-white-footnote" class="fnref" id="hayden-white">1</a> cannot respect the autonomy of historical subjects. It must treat them as objects readily willing to accept categorization and judgment. The historian-(historical) object model of hegistory always maintains that the historian is distant and discrete from the object and that the historian molds the object into historical accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
        The historian-(historical) knower model must replace the historian-(historical) object model for queerstory to work. The historian-knower model holds that the historian and knower are close to one another and may blend into each other. It also treats the knower as the creator of the historical account and the historian as the mere listener to it. These two fundamental ontological differences set up the knower as an equal and opposite to the historian. Their relationship is dialogical and bidirectional. The knower tells a story, and the historian hears it. The historian articulates aesthetic evaluation, and the knower reacts to it. Knowers are not actually present per se; the things which they created and to which they have become intwined are present. These things&mdash;letters, diaries, pictures, newspaper articles, budgets, etc.&mdash;must take the place of the knower. The historian then must resurrect the knower.
    </p>

    <!--Section Three: Animacy:Historian::Magic:Conjurer-->
    <h2>ANIMACY:HISTORIAN::MAGIC:CONJURER&mdash;</h2>
    <p>
        In their book <cite>Animacies</cite>, Mel Chen considers the unnamed and everyday hierarchies of animacies hidden in language and how that characterizes our conception of certain people or things as actors. One mechanism of de-animation is dehumanization, the rendering of humans into animals or things. Chen asserts that dehumanization operates sometimes as taking away human-like qualities and sometimes as the <q>active <em>making</em> of an object.</q> To render the historical subject as a knower requires the heightened sense of what hegistory does to make a historical subject an object. In the first dehumanization procedure, hegistory drains historical subjects of their telling of history asserting an objective telling in its place. In the second dehumanization procedure, which happens especially in structural accounts of history, historical subjects are obliterated into objects affected by institutions. Chen continues on to say that <q>perhaps the most unsparing dehumanization is an approximation toward death.</q><a href="#mel-chen-footnote" class="fnref" id="mel-chen">2</a> It is important to recognize that while death is a loss of animacy that it ought not be a loss of humanity. Historical knowers must be heard for what they have to say, and they must be understood as saying that with some amount of autonomy. Otherwise, the historian strips the historical knower of their claim to the human experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Queerstory enlivens the historical knower with animacy. This reanimated subject allows for the creation of the intersubjective space which unleashes the artful expression of queerstory. In the intersubjective space, there is an ongoing exchange between the historian and knower through the narrative similar to the ongoing exchange between the viewer and artist through the artwork. Just as the viewer must find the expression of the artist&rsquo;s artwork, the historian must find the expression of the knower&rsquo;s narrative. This expression is taken as the proxy for the &ldquo;missing&rdquo; subject and in doing so resurrects it. This proxy intersubjectivity is extrasubjectivity. 
    </p>

    <!--Section Four: The Extrasubjective Dimension-->
    <h2>THE EXTRASUBJECTIVE DIMENSION&mdash;</h2>
    <p>
        The extrasubjective dimension is the liminal space between the knower and the historian. Shared in this space is the narrative (as taken sincerely and agreed upon by both parties), time, and culture. Time functions to separate historian and knower, so when time widens the extrasubjective space shrinks. Culture functions to enjoin historian and knower, so when (shared) culture widens the extrasubjective space enlarges. The larger the extrasubjective space, the more narrative becomes accessible. Note, as some element of time and culture are always shared between knower and historian, by virtue of being human, the extrasubjective domain always exists. Therefore, queerstory is always capable of creating historical accounts because it can always access the extrasubjective dimension.
    </p>
    <p>
        In taking up the extrasubjective, queerstory and art become one in the same. The difference being that art typically takes sensory components to produce the artwork&rsquo;s expression (read: effect). Queerstory typically takes literal components to produce the narrative&rsquo;s expression. This highlights now though that queerstory and literature become one in the same as well. The difference being that literature typically takes more inventive liberty to produce the literary work&rsquo;s expression. Queerstory, while itself inventive, takes real life happenings to produce the narrative&rsquo;s expression. Still, the intersections of art, literature, and queerstory are ambiguous. The concepts are not mutually exclusive. This underscores a return of history to its proper state as a humanity instead of a social science. The focus is not on the resurrection of the objective past but the subjective and invented past of knowers.  
    </p>

    <!--Section Five: The Irrealis Mood-->
    <h2>THE IRREALIS MOOD&mdash;</h2>
    <p>
        A limiting factor in the extrasubjective dimension is time. It especially becomes an obstacle when time has weathered away a narrative so that few documents survive. The lack of signified material prevents a full resurrection of the knower and, as a result, the aesthetic experience tempers. There is a powerful way to overcome this limitation: the irrealis mood. André Aciman in his book Homo Irrealis describes the irrealis as those events which <q>have not happened, may never happen, or should or must or are indeed desired to happen, but for which there is no indication that they will ever happen… the might-be and the might-have-been.</q><a href="#andre-aciman-footnote" class="fnref" id="andre-aciman">3</a> The irrealis has no true tense; it does not happen in the past, present, or future because it has not happened at all. This atemporal nature displaces the fixity of time and allows us to dissolve into the extrasubjective: a realm of intersubjectivity with historical knowers. One best understands this queering of time from the song &ldquo;This is One of Those Moments&rdquo; from the film <cite>Yentl</cite> (1983). Yentl, in her continuous odes to her father, sings, <q>Like a link in a chain from the past to the future that joins me with the children yet to be, I can now be a part of the ongoing stream that has always been a part of me.</q> This chain of being constituted in oneself is a collision of past, present, and future. It is an irreal collapse of time into the ethereal, transcendental, and, above all, sacred spirit of humanity. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Entering the extrasubjective via the irrealis then frees the historian and knower from the constraint of time. Truly, the historian and knower become a sort of unity. It is this unity that one feels when sensing an ancestor&rsquo;s presence in oneself. That tinge of shared being is the irreal condensing in the unstated question: what if we were the same? In the irreal, narrative&rsquo;s extreme proximity in that shared sense of speculative and phantasmic longing allows the historian to grapple with and directly interface with history as a constituent piece of identity. It is as if an artwork was made of oneself. As such, it allows for regeneration, rebirth, rectification, resolution, rejoinder, reconfiguration, resignification, and recognition. It is an extremely deep pondering of the shared sense of being.
    </p>
    <p>
        Queerstory perfectly presents an opportunity for queers to interact with the history of queer folks. The immense shared irreal hope for liberation unites the queer historian to the queer knower. In a queerstorical interaction, the goal ought to be to see oneself in the knower: what if we were the same? Once a connection has been made, and its normal here to feel a zolt of electricity pulse through one’s body at this stage, the knower becomes part of the historian. Suddenly, a wave of self-reflection surges through the body from head to toe. A sense of belonging illuminates. A new way of seeing the world, through the knower’s eyes, beams in. A sensuous desiring, naturally aroused by the uniting of two desiring bodies, pulses through. The experience resists description. It is pre-linguistic. It is sacred. It is bodily reaction. It is queer affect. 
    </p>

    <!--Section Six: Metaqueerstory is Metafuture-->
    <h2>METAQUEERSTORY IS METAFUTURE&mdash;</h2>
    <p>
        Hayden White in Metahistory develops a trifurcated account (reflecting Kantian philosophy) of the narrative structure of history: aesthetic emplotment, cognitive argument, and normative implication. He argues that historical accounts are chronicles&mdash;matter of fact timelines&mdash;fashioned into stories with beginnings, middles, and ends. Historians construct stories into historical accounts through various modes of narrative structure (emplotment), causative purpose (argument), and ideological grounding (implication). To turn the <q>unprocessed historical record</q> into a historical account requires a prefigurative hermeneutic. That is, history can only be made meaningful by first taking certain modes of emplotment, argument, and implication as a prefigurative framework. The historian places the “unprocessed historical record” into this prefigurative scaffolding to then invent the historical narrative and flavors it in poetic tropes. These prefigurative outlines are what White terms metahistories.<a href="#hayden-white2-footnote" class="fnref" id="hayden-white2">4</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        In hegistory, this prefigurative scaffolding is the substance into which historical objects are squeezed. In contrast, queerstory is prelinguistic and bodily. It has no metahistory. It has no outline. The historian instead filters the <q>unprocessed historical record</q> through the irrealis. These filtered irreal fragments form a <em>metaqueerstory.</em> Metaqueerstory is simply a collection of shards from the irrealis. It is the fodder for the fire. The task of the queerstorian is to gather up metaqueerstories into digestible works. There is no right or wrong way to do this so long as the substance of the work is irreal. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The power of these metaqueerstories cannot be understated. They are extremely intense gateways of introspection and (r)evolution. Such strong interactions with the past have immense emancipatory agency. The liberatory nature of metaqueerstory organizes an entirely new metafuture: ways of thinking about the future. These metafutures are beyond our ability to conceive, yet they are sitting within reach. Queerstory must happen now. The historical imbalance must be flipped, historical subjects must be enlivened to knowers, the extrasubjective must be opened, the irrealis must filter through, and the quaking power of metafutures must be unleashed.
